## typecho-theme-void

forked from [AlanDecode/Typecho-Theme-VOID](https://github.com/AlanDecode/Typecho-Theme-VOID) for self-use.

## Why does this repo exist?

The theme files of typecho-theme-void and some common plugins used with the theme have been packaged in this repository. 

I am modifying some files and deploy some css and js files to jsdelivr in order to improve the access speed of some websites using this theme deployed on servers with poor network links to mainland China.
